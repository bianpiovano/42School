││  Piscine
||  The Piscine is an intensive one-month phase that serves as an introduction 
||  to C programming and the command line. During this stage, I worked on daily
||  projects designed to solidify my knowledge in:
|| • Basic C concepts (pointers, arrays, functions)
|| • Version control with git
|| • Writing shell scripts.
││
││ Piscine Reloaded
|| This is a consolidation phase where I deepened my understanding
|| of the concepts learned during the Piscine, honing skills in:
|| • Code optimization.
|| • Programming best practices.
|| • Developing more advanced projects.
||
|| Common Core
|| The Common Core is the main stage of the program, 
|| where I tackled more challenging projects, such as:
|| Libft: Reimplementation of standard C library functions.
|| Get Next Line: Efficient reading of files line by line.
|| ft_printf: Custom implementation of the printf function.
|| Born2BeRoot: A system administration project to set up a virtual machine.
|| Other projects in C++ and advanced shell scripting.
